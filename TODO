- inform apache2 SSL endpoint of the configuration from landscape.  This would
  mean passing it through haproxy to apache2, or establishing a configuration
  relationship between landscape and apache2.  Right now, configuration is
  supplied manually at deploy time.
- Add more documentation in form of juju-deployer file for a more scaled out
  version of and lds deployment
- Create more than one daemon per server.  Make it dependent on instance size
  (probably).
- Make sure all code is in python
- Add some unit tests for tricky parts of code
- Set up end-to-end test.
